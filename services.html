                                                AMR and AMI have become very popular in recent times with most utilities embarking on one such project or another, sometimes without fully understanding the underlying complexities, 
                                                and mostly becoming hostages to solution providers. Adroit relies on its vast experience in this field to guide utilities towards implementing simple, effective, future-proof and cost-effective AMR/AMI projects.

                                                Perhaps the most important of Adroit’s services to utilities is Advisory. The most important aspect of all endeavours has to do with the conceptualization, the very foundation on which such endeavours are based. 
                                                The foundation determines everything after, and if this is wrong or predicated on false expectations, the result is predictable. 
                                                Adroit prides itself in delivering utility-friendly advisory services on which successful plans and projects can be developed.

                                                Bulk metering of such group of consumers is a way utilities evade the huge administrative headaches of providing direct metering to all consumers within the group. 
                                                To a large extent, it is also a good choice for estate and property managers as an amount of power is resident in their hands to ensure overall compliance with property rules. 
                                                This arrangement is not bad if well managed with each stakeholder’s interest taken care of.

                                                Determining and controlling energy usage in institutions such as universities, colleges, military barracks, etc, can be a nightmare. 
                                                It is very common to see such institutions having to pay huge bills to utilities each month which they have no control over.<br><br>
                                                Adroit specializes in assisting such institutions in understanding how energy is utilized and to implement measures to control wastages and indiscriminate usage.

                                                There are so many good products from reputable manufacturers across the world that have acquired unpleasant reputations while being utilized within the Nigerian power industry simply for a lack of support when and where it mattered. 
                                                This has resulted in a sharp drop in sales volume even for products that once dominated the market.<br><br>Adroit provides a specially-tailored service to take the burden of providing local product support off manufacturers, especially where sales volumes do not yet justify a direct investment in this segment. 
                                                Under this service, Adroit’s highly experienced personnel acquire whatever additional knowledge is required to be able to carry on this key function on behalf of the manufacturer in a most efficient and cost effective manner.
